      <h2>Mastering Budgeting</h2>
      <p>Budgeting is more than just tracking expenses — it's about control and intention. Create a monthly plan that aligns with your goals.</p>
      <p>Use the 50/30/20 rule to allocate your income: 50% needs, 30% wants, and 20% savings.</p>
      <p>Use budgeting apps or even spreadsheets to visualize your money flow. Automation can make the process even easier.</p>
      <p>Always revisit and adjust your budget as life changes — flexibility is key.</p>
      <p>Track even the smallest of expenses; they add up faster than you think.</p>

    <section id="saving" class="section">
      <h2>Effective Saving Habits</h2>
      <p>Start small, but start now. Even saving 5% of your income builds the habit of saving consistently.</p>
      <p>Set specific goals — short term (vacation), medium term (car), and long term (house).</p>
      <p>Emergency funds are a must. Aim for 3–6 months of expenses stored away for rainy days.</p>
      <p>Automate your savings. Let it happen without you thinking about it.</p>
      <p>Keep savings in a separate account — out of sight, out of mind.</p>

    <section id="investing" class="section">
      <h2>Start Investing Early</h2>
      <p>Investing can grow your wealth exponentially over time thanks to the power of compounding.</p>
      <p>Start with low-risk options like index funds or ETFs and diversify your portfolio.</p>
      <p>Don't try to time the market. Stay consistent and invest regularly.</p>
      <p>Learn about risk tolerance. Know your limits and adjust your investments accordingly.</p>
      <p>Use tax-advantaged accounts when possible to maximize growth.</p>

    <section id="debt" class="section">
      <h2>Dealing with Debt</h2>
      <p>Not all debt is bad, but it must be managed wisely. Know the difference between good debt and bad debt.</p>
      <p>Focus on high-interest debts first (like credit cards). Use methods like the avalanche or snowball strategy.</p>
      <p>Don’t borrow more than you can afford. Always consider repayment plans before taking on debt.</p>
      <p>Make extra payments when possible — they go a long way toward saving interest.</p>
      <p>Keep track of due dates. Set reminders or auto-pay to avoid penalties.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="retirement" class="section">
      <h2>Planning for Retirement</h2>
      <p>The earlier you start planning for retirement, the more freedom you gain later in life.</p>
      <p>Invest in retirement accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s and contribute consistently.</p>
      <p>Understand how much you’ll need by estimating future expenses, healthcare, and lifestyle goals.</p>
      <p>Consider diversifying retirement income through investments, side businesses, or real estate.</p>
      <p>Don’t rely on a single source of income. Create a plan that includes safety nets.</p>
